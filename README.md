# sentiment-analysis-on-tweet-data
This project is about analyzing the polarity of a tweet by using millions of data achieved through NLP (Sentimental Analysis). The dataset contains approximately 1.6 million unique records with an attribute containing ratings from 0 to 4 (0 being negative, 4 being positive and 2 being neutral), emphasizing the polarity of the tweet. The idea is to divide the tweets into several tokens and apply some NLP Processing on them to obtain our desired result. After developing the product, it will then be available to other users to be used for checking the possible sentiment of a newer tweet.
